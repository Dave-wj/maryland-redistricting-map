# CONGRESSIONAL BRIEFING MEMORANDUM

## Proposed Changes to Maryland's 8th Congressional District

**Prepared for:** Congressional Review
**Date:** January 21, 2026
**Subject:** Analysis of Proposed Redistricting Plan - District 8 (Kunes Submission)
**Classification:** Unclassified

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The proposed redistricting plan (DKunes_Submission) fundamentally reconfigures Maryland's 8th Congressional District. The proposal removes all Prince George's County territory from CD-8 while adding substantial portions of Carroll County and southern Frederick County. This represents a significant geographic and demographic shift, expanding the district northward into rural/suburban territory while consolidating its presence in central and northern Montgomery County.

**Key Changes at a Glance:**

| Factor | Current CD-8 | Proposed CD-8 |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Primary Counties | Montgomery, Prince George's (small portion) | Montgomery, Carroll, Frederick |
| Total Land Area | ~230 sq mi (est.) | 664 sq mi |
| Character | Urban/Suburban D.C. suburbs | Mixed urban/suburban/rural |
| Geographic Focus | Southern/Central Montgomery + PG slice | Central/Northern Montgomery + Carroll + Frederick |

## PART II: PROPOSED DISTRICT 8 ANALYSIS

### Geographic Composition

The proposed District 8 comprises **8,468 census blocks** across three counties, covering approximately **664 square miles** of land area.

| County | Census Blocks | Land Area | % of District |
|--------|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| Carroll | 1,742 | 306 sq mi | 46.0% |
| Montgomery | 6,111 | 217 sq mi | 32.6% |
| Frederick | 615 | 142 sq mi | 21.4% |

### Montgomery County Analysis

**Census Blocks:** 6,111 of 9,513 total (64.2% of county)

The proposed plan retains the core of Montgomery County in District 8 but shifts significant portions to other districts:
- District 4 receives 913 blocks (9.6%)
- District 6 receives 2,489 blocks (26.2%)

**Communities REMAINING in Proposed District 8:**

| Community | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Bethesda | IN District 8 |
| Rockville | IN District 8 |
| Silver Spring (downtown) | IN District 8 |
| Takoma Park | IN District 8 |
| Chevy Chase | IN District 8 |
| Wheaton | IN District 8 |
| Aspen Hill | IN District 8 (partial, border with D-4) |
| Kensington | IN District 8 |
| Olney | IN District 8 |
| Damascus | IN District 8 |
| Laytonsville | IN District 8 |
| **Leisure World** | **IN District 8** |

**Communities MOVING to District 4:**

|-----------|-------------|
| Colesville | District 4 |
| Burtonsville | District 4 |
| White Oak | District 4 (primarily) |

| Clarksburg | District 6 |
| North Potomac | District 6 |
| Boyds | District 6 |
| Poolesville | District 6 |
| Darnestown | District 6 |
| Travilah | District 6 |

### Carroll County Analysis (NEW ADDITION)

**Census Blocks:** 1,742 of 2,565 total (67.9% of county)

The proposed plan adds a majority of Carroll County to District 8, including the county seat of Westminster. This represents a return to pre-2013 configurations.

**Carroll County Communities in Proposed District 8:**
- Westminster (county seat)
- Taneytown
- Mount Airy
- Manchester
- New Windsor
- Union Bridge

**Carroll County Communities in District 3:**
- Eldersburg
- Sykesville
- Hampstead

### Frederick County Analysis (NEW ADDITION)

**Census Blocks:** 615 of 4,667 total (13.2% of county)

The proposed plan adds southern Frederick County to District 8, specifically:

**In Proposed District 8:**
- New Market

**Remaining in District 6:**
- Frederick City (county seat)
- Thurmont
- Emmitsburg
- Brunswick
- Middletown
- Walkersville
- Urbana
- Woodsboro
- Myersville

### Prince George's County Analysis (REMOVAL)

**Census Blocks in Proposed D-8:** 0 (complete removal)

The current small portion of Prince George's County in CD-8 (primarily around Takoma Park) is entirely reassigned to District 4.

---

## PART III: COMMUNITY IMPACT ANALYSIS

### 1. Leisure World Senior Community

**Status: CONFIRMED IN DISTRICT 8**

Leisure World, the prominent age-restricted retirement community in Silver Spring (Census Tract 7058), remains within the proposed District 8. However, analysis shows the boundary between Districts 4 and 8 runs near this community:
- 118 nearby census blocks in District 8
- 50 nearby census blocks in District 4

Neighboring communities to the east (Colesville, Burtonsville) will move to District 4, potentially affecting community connections.

### 2. Federal Facilities

| Facility | Proposed District |
|----------|------------------|
| NIH (Bethesda) | District 8 |
| FDA (White Oak) | District 8 |
| Walter Reed NNMC | District 8 |
| NOAA/NIST (Gaithersburg) | District 6 |

The major federal employment centers remain in District 8, except for the NOAA/NIST campus which would move to District 6 with Gaithersburg.

### 3. Urban/Suburban Core Retention

The proposal maintains the traditional CD-8 urban/suburban character by keeping:
- Downtown Bethesda commercial district
- Rockville city center
- Silver Spring urban core
- Metro-accessible communities along the Red Line

### 4. Eastern Montgomery County Border Communities

The eastern edge of Montgomery County near the Prince George's border shows complex split patterns:

| Community | Blocks in D-8 | Blocks in D-4 |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| Langley Park (Mont. portion) | 138 | --- |
| Four Corners | 342 | 17 |
| Adelphi (Mont. portion) | 47 | 6 |
| White Oak | 18 | 141 |

---

## PART IV: KEY CONSTITUENCIES AFFECTED

### Constituencies Remaining in District 8

1. **Affluent Inner Suburbs:** Bethesda, Chevy Chase, Potomac residents remain, maintaining the district's high-income demographic profile (partially - Potomac moves to D-6)

2. **Federal Workforce:** NIH, FDA, and Walter Reed employees/contractors continue to be represented by the D-8 representative

3. **Senior Communities:** Leisure World and surrounding retirement-age populations remain

4. **Diverse Urban Communities:** Silver Spring and Takoma Park's diverse populations (including Ethiopian American community) remain

5. **Central Montgomery Suburbs:** Rockville, Wheaton, Kensington communities maintained

### Constituencies Moving OUT of District 8

1. **Prince George's County Residents:** All PG County territory (Takoma Park portion, Hillandale, Calverton) moves to District 4

2. **Gaithersburg/Germantown:** These rapidly growing communities (combined pop. ~150,000+) move to District 6

3. **Eastern Montgomery:** Colesville, Burtonsville, Fairland communities move to District 4

4. **Western Montgomery:** Potomac, Poolesville, Darnestown move to District 6

### Constituencies Moving INTO District 8

1. **Carroll County (Westminster Area):** Rural/suburban Carroll County communities including Westminster, Taneytown, Manchester, Mount Airy join D-8

2. **Southern Frederick County:** New Market and surrounding areas join D-8

---

## PART V: COMPARISON SUMMARY

### Areas REMOVED from CD-8

| Area | New District | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| All Prince George's County territory | District 4 | Removes diverse PG communities |
| Gaithersburg | District 6 | Major city (~70,000 pop) leaves |
| Germantown | District 6 | Large community (~90,000 pop) leaves |
| Potomac | District 6 | Affluent community leaves |
| Colesville/Burtonsville | District 4 | Eastern Montgomery moves out |
| Clarksburg | District 6 | Growing community leaves |
| NOAA/NIST Federal Campus | District 6 | Federal facility moves out |

### Areas ADDED to CD-8

| Area | Previous District | Impact |
|------|------------------|--------|
| Westminster, MD | Was in CD-1 or CD-3 | Carroll County seat joins |
| Most of Carroll County | Various | Rural/suburban county added |
| Southern Frederick County | District 6 | Partial Frederick added |
| New Market, MD | District 6 | Small Frederick community joins |

### Net Geographic Impact

- **Land area increase:** From ~230 sq mi to 664 sq mi (~189% increase)
- **County composition:** From 1.5 counties to 3 counties
- **Character shift:** From primarily urban/suburban to mixed urban/suburban/rural
- **Geographic center:** Shifts northward from central Montgomery toward Carroll County

---

## PART VI: POLITICAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC IMPLICATIONS

### Current CD-8 Profile
- Cook PVI: D+30
- Heavily Democratic, suburban/urban
- High education and income levels
- Significant immigrant population
- Strong federal employee presence

### Likely Impact of Proposed Changes

1. **Carroll County Addition:** Carroll County has historically leaned Republican. Adding 68% of the county to D-8 would likely reduce the Democratic lean of the district.

2. **Gaithersburg/Germantown Removal:** These diverse, growing communities vote Democratic. Their removal to D-6 would reduce D-8's Democratic base.

3. **Prince George's Removal:** Even the small PG portion removed is heavily Democratic.

4. **Net Effect:** The proposed changes would likely moderate the district's partisan lean, though it would likely remain Democratic given Montgomery County's strong Democratic voting patterns.

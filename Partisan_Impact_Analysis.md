# Partisan Impact Analysis: DKunes_Submission Maryland Redistricting Proposal

**Prepared:** January 2026
**Analysis Type:** Partisan Impact Assessment
**Proposal:** DKunes_Submission Redistricting Map

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines the partisan implications of the DKunes_Submission redistricting proposal for Maryland's congressional districts. The proposal makes significant changes to District 8, shifting heavily Democratic suburban areas to Districts 4 and 6 while adding Republican-leaning Carroll County and southern Frederick County to District 8.

**Key Finding:** The proposal would make District 8 significantly more competitive while strengthening the Democratic lean of Districts 4 and 6. This represents a shift from the current 7D-1R delegation structure toward potentially creating a more competitive seat.

## Section 3: Key Geographic Shifts and Partisan Impact

### DISTRICT 8 ANALYSIS (Most Significant Changes)

#### Areas REMOVED from District 8:

**1. Gaithersburg/Germantown (~160,000 population) - Moved to D-6**
- **Partisan Lean:** Strongly Democratic (D+25 to D+30 estimated)
- **2024 Voting Pattern:** Approximately 70-75% Democratic
- **Impact of Removal:** Removes ~100,000+ reliable Democratic votes from D-8

**2. Potomac - Moved to D-6**
- **Partisan Lean:** Strongly Democratic (D+25 estimated)
- **Character:** Wealthy, highly educated suburb
- **Impact of Removal:** Removes affluent Democratic voters

**3. Eastern Montgomery (Colesville, Burtonsville, White Oak) - Moved to D-4**
- **Partisan Lean:** Very strongly Democratic (D+30 to D+35)
- **Demographics:** Diverse, heavily Democratic area adjacent to Prince George's County
- **Impact of Removal:** Removes some of the most Democratic precincts from D-8

#### Areas ADDED to District 8:

**1. Carroll County (Westminster, etc.) - Full County**
- **Partisan Lean:** R+25 (approximately)
- **2024 Vote:** 60.66% Trump, 35.91% Harris
- **Population Added:** ~173,000
- **Impact:** Adds ~40,000+ net Republican votes

**2. Southern Frederick County**
- **Partisan Lean:** Mixed, slightly Democratic overall but rural areas lean Republican
- **2024 Vote:** County went narrowly for Harris
- **Impact:** Adds swing/competitive voters

#### Estimated New Partisan Lean for District 8:

| Metric | Current D-8 | Proposed D-8 | Change |
|--------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| Cook PVI | D+29 | D+8 to D+12 | -17 to -21 points |
| Dem Presidential % | ~78% | ~58-62% | -16 to -20 points |
| Competitiveness | Safe D | Likely D | More competitive |

**Assessment:** District 8 transforms from a **safe Democratic seat** (one of the 25 most Democratic in the nation) to a **likely Democratic seat** that could become competitive in wave elections.

---

### DISTRICT 6 ANALYSIS

#### Current Status:
- **Cook PVI:** D+2 (most competitive district in Maryland)
- **2024 Result:** McClain Delaney (D) won 53.05%
- **Character:** Western Maryland rural areas + Montgomery County suburbs

#### Changes Under Proposal:
- **GAINS:** Gaithersburg, Germantown (~160K pop), Potomac from D-8

#### Impact Assessment:
| Metric | Current D-6 | Proposed D-6 | Change |
|--------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| Cook PVI | D+2 | D+8 to D+12 | +6 to +10 points |
| Character | Competitive | Likely D | Less competitive |

**Assessment:** District 6 becomes **significantly more Democratic** and moves from the competitive category to a likely/safe Democratic seat. The addition of heavily Democratic Gaithersburg/Germantown would offset the Republican-leaning Western Maryland counties.

---

### DISTRICT 4 ANALYSIS

#### Current Status:
- **Cook PVI:** D+39 (4th most Democratic district nationally)
- **2024 Result:** Glenn Ivey (D) won 88.42%
- **Character:** Prince George's County, majority-minority district

#### Changes Under Proposal:
- **GAINS:** Eastern Montgomery (Colesville, Burtonsville, White Oak) from D-8
- **GAINS:** All PG County portions previously in D-8

#### Impact Assessment:
| Metric | Current D-4 | Proposed D-4 | Change |
|--------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| Cook PVI | D+39 | D+38 to D+40 | Minimal |
| Character | Safe D | Safe D | No change |

**Assessment:** District 4 remains an **extremely safe Democratic seat**. Adding eastern Montgomery slightly diversifies the district but maintains its overwhelming Democratic character.

## Section 4: Net Partisan Assessment

### Districts Becoming MORE DEMOCRATIC:

| District | Current PVI | Estimated New PVI | Shift |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| **MD-6** | D+2 | D+8 to D+12 | +6 to +10 |

## Section 6: Key Findings and Conclusions

### Summary of Partisan Effects:

1. **District 8 Transformation:** The most significant change is to District 8, which goes from being the 21st most Democratic district in the nation (D+29) to a likely Democratic but potentially competitive seat (estimated D+8 to D+12). This is primarily due to:
   - Removal of ~160,000 heavily Democratic voters (Gaithersburg/Germantown)
   - Removal of strongly Democratic eastern Montgomery County areas
   - Addition of strongly Republican Carroll County (~173,000 population, R+25)

2. **District 6 Consolidation:** District 6 moves from being Maryland's only competitive seat (D+2) to a likely safe Democratic seat (D+8 to D+12) by absorbing the Democratic suburbs removed from District 8.

3. **Net Effect:** The proposal essentially **trades competitiveness** - making District 6 safer for Democrats while making District 8 more competitive for Republicans.

4. **Statewide Balance:** In typical election environments, the delegation remains 7D-1R. However, in strong Republican wave years, District 8 could become competitive, potentially enabling a 6D-2R outcome.

### Political Considerations:

- **For Democrats:** The proposal removes "wasted" Democratic votes from the already-safe D-8 and uses them to shore up the competitive D-6.
- **For Republicans:** The proposal creates a more realistic path to a second Maryland congressional seat by making D-8 significantly more competitive.
- **For Competitiveness:** The net effect is neutral - one competitive seat becomes safer, while one safe seat becomes more competitive.
